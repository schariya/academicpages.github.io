I am a third-year Ms/PhD student in computer science at UMass Amherst. I am advised by Cameron Musco.

I am broadly interested in machine learning involving network data and graph-based algorithms. My recent work centers around learning or inverting low-dimensional representations for networks. I am more generally interested in connections between recent, “deep” methods and classical methods and how these connections can inform theoretical understanding of deep learning as well as new simplifications and advancements.
